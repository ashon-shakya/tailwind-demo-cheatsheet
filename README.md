# Tailwind CSS Utility Classes Cheatsheet

## Overview

This project is a Tailwind CSS Utility Classes Cheatsheet, designed as an educational resource by **Dented Code Academy**. It provides a comprehensive guide to key Tailwind CSS utility classes, demonstrated through examples based on a card component design. The cheatsheet is styled to match the Dented Code Academy theme, featuring a dark background, blue and red accents, and a clean, modern layout.

The cheatsheet is implemented as a single HTML file (`index.html`) that uses Tailwind CSS via a CDN. It includes custom styles for layout and theming, ensuring a visually appealing and functional presentation.

## Features

- **Structured Layout**: Organized into sections such as Body Styling, Card Container, Card Image, Card Content, Time Ago Text, Post Title, Post Description, Card Stats Footer, and Individual Stats Classes.
- **Interactive Examples**: Each utility class is accompanied by a description and a visual example within a styled container.
- **Themed Design**: Uses a dark background (`bg-black`, `bg-gray-900`) with blue (`text-blue-500`) and red (`text-red-500`) accents to align with the Dented Code Academy logo.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Tailwind's responsive classes (e.g., `max-w-4xl`, `mx-auto`) for optimal display across devices.
- **Custom Styling**: Includes custom CSS for section borders, example boxes, and layout consistency.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the cheatsheet content, Tailwind CSS integration, and custom styles.
- **logo.png**: Placeholder for the Dented Code Academy logo (replace with the actual logo file).
- **bg.jpg**: Placeholder for example images used in demonstrations (replace with actual image files).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download**: Obtain the project files by cloning the repository or downloading the `index.html` file.
2. **Replace Assets**:
   - Update the `<img src="logo.png">` path in `index.html` to point to the actual Dented Code Academy logo.
   - Update the `<img src="bg.jpg">` paths to point to actual image files for demonstrations.
3. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` in a web browser. The Tailwind CSS library is loaded via CDN (`https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`), so no additional setup is required.
4. **Optional Local Hosting**: For development or testing, serve the file using a local server (e.g., `live-server` or a simple Python server: `python -m http.server`).

## Usage

- **Browse Sections**: Navigate through the cheatsheet sections to explore Tailwind CSS utility classes, such as `bg-gray-900`, `flex`, `rounded-lg`, and more.
- **View Examples**: Each class includes a practical example in a styled box, showing how the class affects the appearance or layout.
- **Learn and Apply**: Use the cheatsheet as a reference when building projects with Tailwind CSS, applying the demonstrated classes to your own designs.

## Customization

- **Update Logo**: Replace `logo.png` with your organization's logo and adjust the `w-48` class if a different size is needed.
- **Modify Colors**: Adjust the color classes (e.g., `text-blue-500`, `text-red-500`) in the HTML or custom `<style>` section to match your brand.
- **Add Classes**: Extend the cheatsheet by adding new sections or utility classes, following the existing structure (e.g., `<div class="cheatsheet-section">`).
- **Enhance Styling**: Modify the custom CSS in the `<style>` tag to change borders, backgrounds, or other visual elements.

## Dependencies

- **Tailwind CSS**: Loaded via CDN (`https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`). No local installation is required.
- **Internet Connection**: Required to load Tailwind CSS from the CDN when viewing the cheatsheet.

## Notes

- The cheatsheet assumes placeholder images (`logo.png`, `bg.jpg`). Replace these with actual files to avoid broken image links.
- The `<script>` at the bottom of `index.html` is related to a Cloudflare challenge platform and may not be necessary for local use. It can be removed if not required.
- The `min-h-screen` class example is simulated within a container, as the full viewport height effect is context-dependent.
